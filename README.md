# Wine Rack
My final project for the Udacity iOS Nanodegree

## Purpose of the app
The purpose of Wine Rack is for the user to keep a log of wines they have recently enjoyed, and a wish list of wines they have been recommended that they would like to try in the future. The user can search for wines, add them to either of the two lists and read detailed information about the wines they search for. Users can also remove wines from either list, if they choose.

## Using the app
When a user first opens the app, they can see that there are two buttons at the bottom of the screen – 'My Wines' and 'Wishlist'. The initial view is that of the 'My Wines' view, which is a log of the wines they have added to their wine rack. On clicking the 'Wishlist' button, the user is taken to a similar view, where they will be able to view the wines they would like to try in the future. On both screens, there are helpful message indicating that the user needs to search for wines by clicking the search icon in the top corner of the screen.

Upon clicking the search icon, the user is presented with a third view, featuring a search box and button. The user may enter a specific search term for what they want to look for and click the 'search' button. The app will then search wine.com's database and return the top results as a list, displaying useful info such as the wines name, vintage and label image.

There are 3 buttons accompanying each wine – info, wine rack button and wishlist button. Tapping the 'info' button will navigate to the browser and display the full information for that wine. The user can get back to the app by clicking the 'Wine Rack' link in the top status bar. By tapping the 'wine rack' button (featuring the wine bottle icon) the wine will be saved to the users 'My Wines' list, and by tapping the 'wishlist' button (featuring the heart icon), the wine will be saved to the wishlist. The user can get back to the last of these lists they viewed by clicking the 'X' icon in the top right-hand corner. 

In the event that a keyword search doesn't return any results, the user will be notified with a handy alert message, inviting the user to search again for another keyword.

After closing the search page, the user will notice that the wines they have either saved or liked have been placed in the necessary list for the user to go back to at a later time. If they do not want to keep a reference to the particular wine in the future, they can remove the wine by swiping left on the row, and tapping on the remove link.

## Plans for future versions

* Improved onboarding for the users, to give them a better understanding of the benefits of using the app
* A greater number of search results returned, possibly searching for more automatically on scroll of page
* An in-app browser experience, rather than navigating to Safari for wine info
* If a wine has already been added to a list, and appears again in search results, the button is removed from view, with info as to why it is not there
* More imagery of the wine
* Much further down the line, it would be good to add social aspects to the app – sharing, voting, interacting with other users of the app
